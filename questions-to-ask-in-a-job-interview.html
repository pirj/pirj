  26-Apr-2020 <strong>Questions to Ask in a Job Interview</strong>

  <a href=https://github.com/pirj/pirj.github.io/pull/6/files>Comment on this article</a>

  I never plan or prepare for interviews, so a question "do you want to know something about the company" always puzzles me. The same happens when a recruiter reaches out to you with a proposal from an unnamed company. Is it so important for you to know the company name? You'll have to dig for all the details in the company blog and various feedback sites. Not fun.

  If you're like me, I've compiled a list of questions to ask. They cover common differences between companies that really make sense for you as a perspective employee.

  Disclaimer: I'm a back-end Ruby developer, so YMMV. However, the language isn't playing such a big role those days. Operational, administrative, organizational, and architectural questions still apply for other platforms.

  Warning: Those questions are dry, you may not have enough experience to assess the answer, or have a good context what it affects. Some questions imply that you know pros and cons of major possible answers.

  There are some interlinked traps in questions that may reveal the real state of affairs in your prospective employer.

  The time frame for interviewee's question is usually quite limited. Make sure to warn the interviewer that you have a fair amount of questions upfront.

  It's up to you what matters most, and what to ask. Choose wisely.

  Consider this list as a compliment and an update to <a href=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/>Joel Test</a> and <a href=https://myers.io/2017/04/04/the-joel-test-for-2017/>Joel Test for 2017</a>.
