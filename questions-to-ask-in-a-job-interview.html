  26-Apr-2020 <strong>Questions to Ask in a Job Interview</strong>

  <a href=https://github.com/pirj/pirj.github.io/pull/6/files>Comment on this article</a>

  I don't have a habit to plan or prepare for interviews. Company's engineering blog reveals challenges and openness to share best practices. Company's GitHub account shows quality standards.

  That's all I know before the interview. But the question "do you want to know something about the company" during an interview still puzzles me.

  If you're like me, I've compiled a list of questions to ask. They unveil distinctive factors that may affect your choice whether to proceed with them or not.

  Why? Answers to those questions come to you sooner or later when you join a company. And often times you can't change or handle that truth. Those questions can reveal the factors that make your daily job a breeze, or a nightmare. Some answers are better to be known before making a serious decision.

  If you are primarily motivated by the salary, those questions are NOT for you. But are you really?

  Disclaimer: I'm a backend Ruby developer, YMMV. However, the language isn't playing such a big role those days. Operational, administrative, organizational, and architectural questions still apply for companies using other platforms.

  Those questions are dry. You ought to understand why the question has to be asked and pros and cons of major possible answers.

  Profiling and psychological tests intend to ask the same things in different ways. The questions below have similar interlinked traps that may reveal the real state of affairs in your prospective employer.

  The time frame for interviewee's question is quite limited. Make sure that the interviewer knows in advance that you have a fair amount of questions.

  Ask what matters most to you. Choose wisely.

  Consider this list as a compliment and an update to <a href=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/>Joel Test</a> and <a href=https://myers.io/2017/04/04/the-joel-test-for-2017/>Joel Test for 2017</a>.
